    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Instant Pot corned beef recipe is easy to prep and ready in just two hours. The beef brisket is cooked with beer and garlic in an electric pressure cooker to guarantee juicy, tender corned beef every time. If you want to complete the feast, you can cook baby carrots, quartered potatoes, and cabbage wedges in the bottom of the Instant Pot while the corned beef is resting</p>
