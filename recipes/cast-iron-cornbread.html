    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This cast iron cornbread is made with buttermilk and sweetened with honey. It's perfect for bringing to a cookout. It's very inexpensive to make, but that'll be the last thing anyone will be thinking about as they eat it. In fact, you'll probably be asked to bring it to the next gathering</p>

        <li>½ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups buttermilk</li>
